### Executive Summary
The recent test run comprised a total of 42 tests, with 32 passing, 7 failing, 2 classified as flaky, and 1 skipped. While the majority of tests were successful, the failure rate indicates potential issues that need addressing, particularly in the areas of API requests and UI interactions.

### Failure Patterns
1. **API Authorization Issues**: The failure of the Product Search API request suggests potential problems with authentication or authorization mechanisms.
2. **UI Element Visibility and Interaction**: Multiple failures related to UI elements not being visible or clickable indicate possible timing issues or changes in the UI that need to be addressed.
3. **Assertion Failures**: Several tests failed due to assertion mismatches, which may point to discrepancies between expected and actual outcomes, possibly due to recent changes in application behavior.

### Action Plan
1. **Investigate and Resolve API Authorization Failures**: Review the authentication flow for the Product Search API to ensure proper access rights are configured.
2. **Enhance UI Stability**: Analyze the UI tests for timing issues and update locators or increase timeouts as necessary to improve reliability.
3. **Review Recent Changes**: Conduct a thorough review of recent code changes that may have impacted the test outcomes, particularly focusing on areas related to assertions and expected results.
